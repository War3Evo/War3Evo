Welcome to War 3 Evo dot com.  You have joined a Warcraft like Team Fortress two Server.  Let me explain a few of the basics

Listen closely, as I will not repeat myself again, and this will be the only time you ever hear my voice.

Jobs are what you can do.  They contain your skills, abilities, and the ultimate.

There are quite a few commands that you can type into your chat box.

So that I do not confuse you too much, you can type war 3 menu as one whole word into the chat box.

war 3 menu as one word into the chat box will give you a ton of information on how to play war 3 evo.

war 3 help is another one word command that will give you more information about war 3 evo.

You earn Gold by killing other players on this server.  You earn 1 diamond for every game minute you play here.

You can buy items from either shopmenu 1 or shopmenu 2. You will need to type that as a single word.

If you want to earn double gold and experience points, please add, dash, w, 3, e, dash, in front of your name.

Skills can be passive or active.  If they are active you will need to learn how to bind keys.

In order to use an ability, or the ultimate, you will need to first level your character up to the level required by each job

To bind a key you will need to enable developer console.  We have a video link for that on our website, or you can ask help from someone in game.
